# SECURITY

# The API key & private key are required for trading and can be retrieved from
# the Kraken account settings (see «Settings», «API», «Create API Key»).
#
# In case OTP / 2FA is activated for the API key (not the same as the account,
# resp. login OTP / 2FA method), the OTP URI must be defined as well. To get
# a current one-time code, configure the URI, then run `cryptobob otp`.
#

api_key: «your API key»
private_key: «your private key»

# otp_uri: «your OTP URI (optional)»

#
# TRADE PLANS
#
# Trade plans are the scheduled trading orders CryptoBob should execute on
# your behalf.
#
# To find the right trading pair, login to the Kraken dashboard and find the
# desired market. If you found it, run `cryptobob assets` to find the matching
# asset ID's.
#
# For the interval, you can use minutes, hours, days or weeks. Please note,
# that if the global runner interval is higher than the trade plan interval,
# the trade plans will not be executed timely.

# By default, CryptoBob always withdraws the full asset balance. However, if an
# `amount` is defined, CryptoBob will not exceed that amount during the
# withdrawal.
